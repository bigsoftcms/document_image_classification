# Unsupervised Classification of Image Files

## Project Framework

  1. OCR image files and use LDA for topic analysis to start preliminary classification attempt of the image files.
  2. Identify document topics from which tabular data could be extracted to build a database.
  3. Use a neural network to supplement OCR text recognition when quality of image is poor or hand written text is not            recognized by OCR.
  4. Create dashboards to display and analyze database contents.
